## Course Description
Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transactions—is stored in relational databases, and the ability to manipulate and retrieve this data is an increasingly sought-after skill.

In this two-hour introduction to SQL, you'll learn the theory and practice of extracting and organizing data. You'll cover database best practices, SQL queries, and popular SQL variants like PostgreSQL and SQL Server. By the end of the course, you’ll have hands-on experience in SQL and the grounding to start applying it to your projects.
