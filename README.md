# Associate-Data-Engineer-in-SQL
In this repo, you'll learn the fundamental concepts of data engineering, including the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) and Extract-Load-Transform (ELT) workflows. You'll discover how to interact with relational databases such as PostgreSQL to store, modify, and query data.

Moving through the track, you'll pick up techniques for querying structured data using SQL, including joining multiple tables, calculating aggregated statistics, filtering, grouping, and writing subqueries.

Switching gears, you'll go on to discover database design principles such as star and snowflake schemas, and normalization. You'll use this knowledge to perform typical data engineering tasks such as creating, altering, and deleting tables, and enforcing data consistency by casting data to different data types. The track also shows how you can download PostgreSQL to your operating system, along with setting up and modifying users.

Conclude by learning about data warehouse technologies and familiarizing with Snowflake, a popular cloud technology for data engineering!
